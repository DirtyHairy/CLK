/*!
	A JustInTimeActor holds (i) an embedded object with a run_for method; and (ii) an amount
	of time since run_for was last called.

	Time can be added using the += operator. The -> operator can be used to access the
	embedded object. All time accumulated will be pushed to object before the pointer is returned.

	Machines that accumulate HalfCycle time but supply to a Cycle-counted device may supply a
	separate @c TargetTimeScale at template declaration.
