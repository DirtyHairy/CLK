	Packages a ZX80/81-style video feed into a CRT-compatible waveform.

	While sync is active, this feed will output the sync level.

	While sync is inactive, this feed will output the white level unless it is supplied
	with a byte to output. When a byte is supplied for output, it will be interpreted as
	a 1-bit graphic and output over the next 4 cycles, picking between the white level
	and the black level.
