ROM files would ordinarily go here; the copyright status of these is uncertain so they have not been included in this repository. Per http://www.worldofspectrum.org/permits/amstrad-roms.txt, Amstrad themselves allow redistribution but the status of Locomotive's input is unclear.

Expected files:

amsdos.rom
basic464.rom
basic664.rom
basic6128.rom
os464.rom
os664.rom
os6128.rom
