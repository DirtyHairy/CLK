/*!
	A microcycle is an atomic unit of 68000 bus activity — it is a single item large enough
	fully to specify a sequence of bus events that occur without any possible interruption.

	Concretely, a standard read cycle breaks down into at least two microcycles:

		1) a 5 half-cycle length microcycle in which the address strobe is signalled; and
		2) a 3 half-cycle length microcycle in which at least one of the data strobes is
		signalled, and the data bus is sampled.

	That is, assuming DTack were signalled when microcycle (1) ended. If not then additional
	wait state microcycles would fall between those two parts.

	The 68000 data sheet defines when the address becomes valid during microcycle (1), and
	when the address strobe is actually asserted. But those timings are fixed. So simply
	telling you that this was a microcycle during which the address trobe was signalled is
	sufficient fully to describe the bus activity.

	(Aside: see the 68000 template's definition for options re: implicit DTack; if your
	68000 owner can always predict exactly how long it will hold DTack following observation
	of an address-strobing microcycle, it can just supply those periods for accounting and
	avoid the runtime cost of actual DTack emulation. But such as the bus allows.)
