	@discussion Subclasses should implement @c perform_bus_operation(BusOperation operation, uint16_t address, uint8_t *value) in
	order to provide the bus on which the 6502 operates and @c synchronise(), which is called upon completion of a continuous run
	of cycles to allow a subclass to bring any on-demand activities up to date.

	Additional functionality can be provided by the host machine by providing a jam handler and inserting jam opcodes where appropriate;
	that will cause call outs when the program counter reaches those addresses. @c return_from_subroutine can be used to exit from a
	jammed state.
