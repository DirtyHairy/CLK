/*

	A Kaiser-Bessel filter is a real time window filter. It looks at the last n samples
	of an incoming data source and computes a filtered value, which is the value you'd
	get after applying the specified filter, at the centre of the sampling window.

	Hence, if you request a 37 tap filter then filtering introduces a latency of 18
	samples. Suppose you're receiving input at 44,100Hz and using 4097 taps, then you'll
	introduce a latency of 2048 samples, which is about 46ms.

	There's a correlation between the number of taps and the quality of the filtering.
	More samples = better filtering, at the cost of greater latency. Internally, applying
	the filter involves calculating a weighted sum of previous values, so increasing the
	number of taps is quite cheap in processing terms.

	Original source for this filter:
