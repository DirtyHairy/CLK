	//
	// "Before you can read from any of the disk registers you must set up the state of the IWM so that it
	// can pass the data through to the MC68000's address space where you'll be able to read it. To do that,
	// you must first turn off Q7 by reading or writing dBase+q7L. Then turn on Q6 by accessing dBase+q6H.
	// After that, the IWM will be able to pass data from the disk's RD/SENSE line through to you."
	//
	// My understanding:
	//
	//	Q6 = 1, Q7 = 0 reads the status register. The meaning of the top 'SENSE' bit is then determined by
	//	the CA0,1,2 and SEL switches as described in Inside Macintosh, summarised above as RD/SENSE.
