				free delay, bus set delay and bus settle delay are
				implemented using gate delays."

			Therefore this fictitious implementation of an NCR5380 needs
			a way to track time even though the real one doesn't take in
			a clock. This is provided by `run_for`.

			Nevertheless, the clocking doesn't need to be very precise.
			Please provide a clock that is close to 200,000 Hz.
