			is created for the machine to write raw pixel data to.

			@param cycles_per_line The clock rate at which this CRT will be driven, specified as the number
			of cycles expected to take up one whole scanline of the display.
			
			@param common_output_divisor The greatest a priori common divisor of all cycle counts that will be
			supplied to @c output_sync, @c output_data, etc; supply 1 if no greater divisor is known. For many
			machines output will run at a fixed multiple of the clock rate; knowing this divisor can improve
			internal precision.

			@param height_of_dispaly The number of lines that nominally form one field of the display, rounded
			up to the next whole integer.

			@param colour_cycle_numerator Specifies the numerator for the per-line frequency of the colour subcarrier.

			@param colour_cycle_denominator Specifies the denominator for the per-line frequency of the colour subcarrier.
			The colour subcarrier is taken to have colour_cycle_numerator/colour_cycle_denominator cycles per line.

			@param number_of_buffers The number of source data buffers to create for this machine. Machines
			may provide per-clock-cycle data in any form that they consider convenient, supplying a sampling
			function to convert between their data format and either a composite or RGB signal, allowing that
			work to be offloaded onto the GPU and allowing the output signal to be sampled at a rate appropriate
			to the display size.

			@param ... A list of sizes for source data buffers, provided as the number of bytes per sample.
			For compatibility with OpenGL ES, samples should be 1–4 bytes in size. If a machine requires more
			than 4 bytes/sample then it should use multiple buffers.

			@see @c set_rgb_sampling_function , @c set_composite_sampling_function
