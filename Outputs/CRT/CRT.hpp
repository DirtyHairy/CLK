			The requested number of buffers, each with the requested number of bytes per pixel,
			is created for the machine to write raw pixel data to.

			@param cycles_per_line The clock rate at which this CRT will be driven, specified as the number
			of cycles expected to take up one whole scanline of the display.
			
			@param common_output_divisor The greatest a priori common divisor of all cycle counts that will be
			supplied to @c output_sync, @c output_data, etc; supply 1 if no greater divisor is known. For many
			machines output will run at a fixed multiple of the clock rate; knowing this divisor can improve
			internal precision.

			@param height_of_display The number of lines that nominally form one field of the display, rounded
			up to the next whole integer.

			@param colour_cycle_numerator Specifies the numerator for the per-line frequency of the colour subcarrier.

			@param colour_cycle_denominator Specifies the denominator for the per-line frequency of the colour subcarrier.
			The colour subcarrier is taken to have colour_cycle_numerator/colour_cycle_denominator cycles per line.

			@param buffer_depth The depth per pixel of source data buffers to create for this machine. Machines
			may provide per-clock-cycle data in the depth that they consider convenient, supplying a sampling
			function to convert between their data format and either a composite or RGB signal, allowing that
			work to be offloaded onto the GPU and allowing the output signal to be sampled at a rate appropriate
			to the display size.
