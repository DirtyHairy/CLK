		Constructs and returns an instance of OutputShader. OutputShaders are intended to read source data
		from a texture and draw a single raster scan containing that data as output.

		Does not catch any of the exceptions potentially thrown by `Shader::Shader`.

		All instances of OutputShader are guaranteed to use the same attribute locations for their inputs.

		@param fragment_methods A block of code that will appear within the global area of the fragment shader.

		@param colour_expression An expression that should evaluate to a `vec3` indicating the colour at the current location. The
		decision should be a function of the uniform `texID`, which will be either a `usampler2D` or a `sampler2D` as per the
		`use_usampler` parameter, and the inputs `srcCoordinatesVarying` which is a location within the texture from which to
		take the source value, and `iSrcCoordinatesVarying` which is a value proportional to `srcCoordinatesVarying` but scaled
		so that one unit equals one source sample.

		@param use_usampler Dictates the type of the `texID` uniform; will be a `usampler2D` if this parameter is `true`, a
		`sampler2D` otherwise.

		@returns an instance of OutputShader.
