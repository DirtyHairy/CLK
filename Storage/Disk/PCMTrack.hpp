	A segment of PCM-sampled data. The clock rate in the duration is taken to be relative to all other
	segments that comprise a track rather than absolute, and the length is taken to be the number of
	bits from @c data that are actually present.

	Bits from each byte are taken MSB to LSB.

	Actual segment lengths will be calculated such that all segments that comprise a track exactly fill the track.

	So the segment for a track with only a single segment may supply any clock rate other than 0. It will exactly
	fill the track, so if it has 7 samples then there will be at most a flux transition every 1/7th of a rotation.

	If a track consists of two segments, one with clock rate 1 and one with clock rate 2, the second will be
	clocked twice as fast as the first.

	The data may consist of a single @c PCMSegment or of multiple, allowing a PCM-format track to contain
	multiple distinct segments of data, each with a separate clock rate.
