	Provides the shell for emulating a disk controller — something that is connected to a disk drive and uses a
	phase locked loop ('PLL') to decode a bit stream from the surface of the disk.

	Partly abstract; it is expected that subclasses will provide methods to deal with receiving a newly-recognised
	bit from the PLL and with crossing the index hole.

	TODO: communication of head size and permissible stepping extents, appropriate simulation of gain.
