	Models a tape as a sequence of pulses, each pulse being of arbitrary length and described
	by their relationship with zero:
		- high pulses exit from zero upward before returning to it;
		- low pulses exit from zero downward before returning to it;
		- zero pulses run along zero.
		
	Subclasses should implement at least @c get_next_pulse and @c reset to provide a serial feeding
	of pulses and the ability to return to the start of the feed. They may also implement @c seek if
	a better implementation than a linear search from the @c reset time can be implemented.
